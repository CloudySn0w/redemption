# Unbound iOS Loader - Revenge Next Bundle Integration

This document provides detailed information about the Revenge Next Bundle integration with the Unbound iOS Loader.

## Overview

This modified version of the Unbound iOS Loader includes a comprehensive compatibility layer that enables loading and executing the Revenge Next Bundle on iOS devices. The integration addresses the fundamental challenges of cross-platform compatibility between Android-focused Revenge Next Bundle and iOS-focused Unbound Loader.

## Key Components

### 1. RevengeCompatibilityLayer (.x/.h)

The core compatibility layer that handles:
- **Hermes Bytecode Loading**: Manages loading and execution of Revenge Next's Hermes bytecode
- **Metro Patching**: Implements Revenge's Metro bundler modifications for iOS
- **Native Bridge Extensions**: Provides Revenge-specific native method implementations
- **Plugin System Integration**: Bridges Revenge plugins with Unbound's plugin system
- **Theme System Compatibility**: Handles Revenge theme application through Unbound's theme system

### 2. Modified Tweak.xm

Enhanced main tweak file that:
- Integrates the Revenge compatibility layer into Unbound's initialization process
- Hooks into Discord's WebView for JavaScript injection
- Extends the native bridge for Revenge-specific calls
- Adds Revenge-specific settings to Unbound's configuration system
- Monitors for conflicts between Unbound and Revenge functionality

### 3. Enhanced Build System

- **Modified Makefile**: Includes Revenge compatibility flags and dependencies
- **Updated Control File**: Reflects the enhanced package with Revenge support
- **Build Targets**: Provides development, release, and debug build configurations

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Jailbroken iOS Device** (iOS 14.0+)
2. **Theos Development Environment** (for building from source)
3. **ElleKit** (dependency for tweak runtime)
4. **Discord iOS App** (target application)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd unbound-ios-loader-revenge

# Build the package
make package

# Install on device
make install
```

### Pre-built Installation

1. Add the Unbound repository to your package manager
2. Install "Unbound iOS Loader (Revenge Compatible)"
3. Respring your device
4. Configure Revenge integration in Unbound settings

## Configuration

### Enabling Revenge Integration

1. Open Unbound settings in Discord
2. Navigate to "Advanced" â†’ "Revenge Integration"
3. Enable "Revenge Next Bundle Support"
4. Configure auto-loading preferences
5. Restart Discord

### Configuration Files

- **Revenge Bundle**: Place in `/var/mobile/Documents/Unbound/revenge-bundle/`
- **Configuration**: `/var/mobile/Documents/Unbound/revenge-config.json`

Example configuration:
```json
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "platform": "ios",
    "compatibility_mode": true,
    "metro_patches": true,
    "native_bridge": true,
    "auto_load": true,
    "debug_logging": false
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Hermes Bytecode Handling

The compatibility layer implements several strategies for handling Revenge's Hermes bytecode:

1. **Direct Execution** (if Hermes is available on iOS)
2. **Bytecode Transpilation** (converting to standard JavaScript)
3. **Simulation Mode** (for testing and development)

### Metro Patching Strategy

Revenge Next Bundle heavily modifies Discord's Metro bundler. Our implementation:

1. **Intercepts Metro Functions**: Hooks into `__d`, `__r`, `importDefault`, `importAll`
2. **Applies Revenge Patches**: Replicates the effects of Revenge's `_internal.ts`
3. **Maintains Compatibility**: Ensures Unbound's existing Metro modifications continue to work
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Manages execution order to prevent conflicts

### Native Bridge Extensions

Extended native methods for Revenge compatibility:

- `RevengeLogger.nativeLoggingHook`: Handles Revenge's native logging
- `RevengeFileSystem.readRevengeFile`: File system operations for Revenge assets
- `RevengeThemes.applyRevengeTheme`: Theme application through Unbound's system
- `RevengePlugins.loadPlugin`: Plugin loading and management

## Limitations and Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Hermes Bytecode**: Full Hermes engine integration not implemented
2. **Android-Specific Features**: Some Revenge features may not work on iOS
3. **Performance**: Compatibility layer may introduce overhead
4. **Plugin Compatibility**: Not all Revenge plugins may work correctly

### Known Issues

1. **Metro Conflicts**: Potential conflicts with complex Metro modifications
2. **Memory Usage**: Increased memory usage due to dual bundle loading
3. **Stability**: Beta-level stability, may cause crashes in some scenarios

### Workarounds

- **Simulation Mode**: Use for testing without full Hermes integration
- **Selective Loading**: Disable problematic Revenge features
- **Debug Logging**: Enable for troubleshooting issues

## Development

### Building for Development

```bash
# Development build with debug logging
make debug

# Clean build
make clean

# Test installation
make test
```

### Debugging

Enable debug logging in configuration:
```json
{
    "debug_logging": true
}
```

View logs:
```bash
# Real-time log monitoring
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep Unbound

# Or use Console app on macOS with connected device
```

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement changes with proper logging
4. Test thoroughly on multiple iOS versions
5. Submit pull request with detailed description

## Security Considerations

### Permissions

The enhanced loader requires additional permissions:
- File system access for Revenge bundle storage
- Extended native bridge capabilities
- WebView JavaScript injection rights

### Privacy

- No additional data collection beyond standard Unbound functionality
- Revenge bundle execution is sandboxed within Discord's context
- Native bridge calls are logged for security auditing

## Support

### Getting Help

1. **Documentation**: Check this README
2. **Logs**: Enable debug logging and check system logs
